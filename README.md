Features
Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and address outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the HR data through visualization and statistical analysis.
Visualization and reporting: Communicate key findings and insights effectively through visualizations and reports.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

Usage
Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/your-username/hr-analytics-python.git
